# ðŸ”— Logic Gate Network (LGN) for Binary Classification

This project implements a CPU-efficient **Logic Gate Network (LGN)** trained via differentiable logic gates to learn interpretable logical rules using only binary logic operations.

It supports:
- Training on synthetic binary data generated from custom logic rules.
- Differentiable logic gate layers with 16 logic ops.
- Inference benchmarking on CPU.
- Accuracy comparison against true logical labels.
